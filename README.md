## War Card Game

This program allows you to play a game of war with the "computer"

## Gameplay Description

War can be played in a couple different ways. I followed the description outlined on the [Bicycle Cards Website](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/war). In this version, when War is initiated, both players put one card face down and one card face up. Winner takes the whole pile of six cards.\
All the user has to do is press [Enter] when they are ready to see the next play. The game ends when one player has all the cards.
